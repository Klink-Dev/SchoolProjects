## Purpose:

  This web page is the homepage of an interplanetary airline company. This homepage has an advertisement for a “Special Offer” on planetary travel using an animated transition to show the user a form to enter their information to sign up for a discount.

## Background:

### For this course, however, use this section instead to describe the concepts this particular app was designed to help you learn
	
  The modifications in this app are designed to help me learn how to manipulate a HTML5 canvas, 	modify a CSS transition, and store user data locally on the client.

## High-Level Software Process Overview:

This is a web app accessible through a web browser designed to show a transition when the cursor is hovered over the canvas element, which changes to a form for collecting information on the user. The user will click buttons, and click and drag a range bar.

## Functional Requirements:

### For this course, however, simply list what data, if any, users are expected to input, and what data, if any, will be displayed on the screen as a result.

Inputs:
```
Gender
Age
```
Outputs:
```N/A```

## Additional Features and Functions:
* Highlight features of animated canvas by adding red border, modifying the size and style of the font, and changing the text to explicit instructions to activate the transition
* Increased transition duration
* Change form from discount offer to default values
* Output on canvas based on user inputs
